The dooHTM is c# a Hello World application that permits a first glance at Numenta's Hierarchical
Temporal Memory (HTM) algorithms using very simple generated motion images.

The application make use of the Emgu CV library, the wrapper to the OpenCV image library.
The library's files are included in the project and automatically copied to the
bin\Debug directory during the build phase.

The source code comments are practically totally get from Numenta's paper, nevertheless I hope the code
is tidy enough to allow a fast understanding.

The application is in a early development and I queued a lot of improvements.

I do not guarantee that the source code respects the Numenta's algorithms and his intent and in fact I
have still several doubt, in any case I hope the application will be of some utility.
